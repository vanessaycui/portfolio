            <div class="about-content" >
                <p> Hello! My name is Vanessa and I’m a Software Developer with a professional background in engineering.</p>
                 <p> I have a passion for designing and building full-stack applications with the potential to positively impact society on a global-scale. With my engineering background, I am adept at critical thinking, problem solving, and finding creative solutions to challenging technical problems. My previous experience in consulting has allowed me to hone my ability to effectively work in a multidisciplinary team of engineers to solve complex problems. 

                            I love learning about new technologies and working on personal projects during my free time. I'm always curious about how things work and I will always try to find ways to make it better!</p>
